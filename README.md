# üåÄ Spring Pendulum Simulator (Tkinter GUI)

This is a spring pendulum simulator using Python and Tkinter for GUI. It numerically solves a 2D spring pendulum with two degrees of freedom using the Runge-Kutta method, and visualizes the result in real time.

## üß© Features
- Real-time GUI input for:
  - Mass
  - Spring constant
  - Initial position
  - Initial velocity
- Spring animation with coils
- Energy diagram (kinetic, potential, total)

Certainly! Here‚Äôs your explanation translated into clear, academic English for your `README.md`:

\section*{Model Description}

This simulation is based on the following physical model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The spring pendulum is suspended from the origin, with spring constant $k$ and mass $m$.
    \item The position vector of the mass is $\vec{r} = r_x \hat{i} + r_y \hat{j}$, and the natural length of the spring is $r_0$.
    \item The spring force is given by 
    \[
    \vec{F}_s = -k(|\vec{r}| - r_0) \frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|},
    \]
    where $|\vec{r}| = \sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2}$.
\end{itemize}

The forces acting on the mass are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spring restoring force $\vec{F}_s$
    \item Gravitational force $mg$ (downward)
\end{itemize}

According to Newton's second law, the equations of motion are:
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{r}_x &= -\frac{k (|\vec{r}| - r_0)}{m|\vec{r}|} r_x \\
\ddot{r}_y &= g - \frac{k (|\vec{r}| - r_0)}{m|\vec{r}|} r_y
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]

## Coordinate System

> **The coordinate directions used in this program are consistent with the window (screen) coordinates: right is $+x$, down is $+y$.**
> **As a result, there is no need for additional coordinate transformations in the simulation code or when drawing the results.**
>
> You can directly use $(r_x, r_y)$ in both calculations and visualization, and the mapping to the display will be correct.
