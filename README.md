# 🌀 Spring Pendulum Simulator (Tkinter GUI)

This is a spring pendulum simulator using Python and Tkinter for GUI. It numerically solves a 2D spring pendulum with two degrees of freedom using the Runge-Kutta method, and visualizes the result in real time.

## 🧩 Features
- Real-time GUI input for:
  - Mass
  - Spring constant
  - Initial position
  - Initial velocity
- Spring animation with coils
- Energy diagram (kinetic, potential, total)

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 📸 Preview

- Right: Energy-time plot

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter (bundled with Python)
- numpy
- matplotlib
